# Bread Ingredients Calculator

In the recent months, I've been preparing my own, delicious bread at home. While the ingredients are simple, getting the amounts right needs quite some knowledge. This simple Go program does exactly that: it takes the kind of bread you're baking and the amount of water or flour and it'll serve the exact formula.

I need this for myself, so I don't search for the right formula everytime I'm baking a different kind of bread or when I forget what the ratios are.

# The Code
I've been learning Go for only a couple of days, so I'm sure the code has it's own share of problems. I'll be improving on it as my skills get better.

The most important part, aside from building something I need, is the learning process. Through a simple program like this, I used plenty of Go's syntax, data types, control structures, remote packages, etc.

# Usage
You can either get the code and build it for your platform(s) of choice, or simply download the built program in `bin/bread`. It was built in OSX without any build tags, so I'll be revisiting the build process too when I understand it better.
